'Hello Word!'
My name is Nur Nazifa Sarah but some may know me as Kitty. This is a collection of my Java projects that I had done on Netbeans and Intellij.
To give a proper and simplified guide for new visitors on my github page, I have organised different sections, files and code into a sort of directory.
